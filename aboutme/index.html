            I'm Chad, this is my 3rd semester at BYUI. I'm from Ohio and I love the beach. Last week I got to go to California and it was so nice :)
I'm about a 7 on technology; my major is computer science and I love math and stats too. I've always wanted to be able to do websites though so I'm excited for this class!
