      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Multiple times every week, I submit my resume online for internship and scholarship applications. Wouldn't it be great if I could better showcase my skill-set and stand out from the crowd? My plan is to create a personal informational website to accompany my many applications.  </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience includes employers, recruiters, and other networking professionals. This will allow them to see my web design talent, look at other projects I complete, and get to know me on a deeper level. It will also include my contact information, LinkedIn url, and a personal bio.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This home page will be the main screen that visitors to my website are guided to. My current plan is a static page without a lot of content or scrolling. It will feature my name and links to my social sites (such as github, LinkedIn, and my email). It will also include my constant header and footer; I think I would like my header to be on the side of the page. The footer will be at the bottom and might have no background. 

        Content:
        "Chad Bell
        Data Scientist | Student | Exceptionally Real"

        "I may not be the best programmer out there -- but I might be the most relatable one. I'm a real guy who loves doing real things and collaborating with real people."
        
        "Really?"
        "Yep. Send me a message and see for yourself."
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>My Real Story</h3>
      <p>
        This page will feature information about myself. It will be less technical in nature and more focused on my story, in addition to hobbies and interests. This will help me be more relatable to recruiters. I was hired for my last job because I put disc golf on my resume; I hope that this page will help me in a similar way. 

        Content:

        "I wrote my first code at 16. 
        After teaching myself the basics of Python, I solved Project Euler's first math problem using my limited knowledge of operators and variables. I was instantly enthralled. 
        
        When my family's small business (a fish farm) needed a software solution to calculate fish growth and feed rate, I knew I could help. While still in high school, I created and implemented an entirely new interface and tracking system using Excel VBA. 
        
        Since then, I have continued to develop my skills in programming, learning Python, Excel VBA, R, and SQL. I am passionate about data analytics, computer science, and software engineering. With my computer science degree underway, I am excited to apply my passion for programming and data to the real world. 
        
        P.S. - I'm also a real person! I love ultimate frisbee, disc golf, triathlons, reading, family, and fun :)"

      </ul>
      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be focused on my resume and experience. It will contain a link to download a current copy of my resume. I can also go more in depth about the places that I have worked and my experiences there. Here, I will also add information about any personal projects that I complete. 

        Content: 
        "Download a current copy of my real resume ->"

        "This semester I created a translator application using a React frontend, Node/Express backend, and Azure's translation api. The translator takes an input in any language and returns translations to English, Armenian, Russian, and Spanish (these are the languages that I am currently learning). This translator helps me learn the equivalent translations of words between languages."
